# Pig Game

GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, Player 1 starts the game by rolling the dice.
- A player can roll the dice as many times as they wish. Each roll gets added to the player's CURRENT score until the player clicks hold. When the player clicks hold the total CURRENT score gets added to their global score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, they lose their total CURRENT score and the game moves to the next player.
- The first player to reach 100 points on their GLOBAL score wins the game!

Have Fun :)
